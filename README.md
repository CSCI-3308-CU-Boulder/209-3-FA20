Our project consists of a website that hosts a platformer video game that we created. The game is called "2020: The Game" and aims to give a lighthearted take on the year 2020 and all the crazy things that have happened. In the game, you play as a character named Common Sense and have to navigate your way past coronavirus sprites en route to obtaining the cure for COVID-19.

One can run our project in one of two ways:
1) access through our website which is hosted on Heroku at http://twentytwentygame.herokuapp.com
2) the other way is to download the game engine Godot, clone our repository, and run the game from there on your local machine

Our Repository structure consists of two main folders:
1) a folder for our project milestones and
2) a folder containing all of our project components

Inside the project components folder one will find a directory containing all of the Godot files which includes all the necessary scripts and scene files to run our game. This is the folder you will need to access if you want to run the game through Godot

Also inside the project components folder is the twentytwentygame.zip file that contains everything needed to produce our website.

The best way to test our code is by launching our website, testing out our features and also playing the game through the website.

We hope you enjoy our project, good luck setting the high score!
